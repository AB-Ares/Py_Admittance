Installation
============

Download the Py_Admittance repository and install using pip (or pip3 depending on your installation) ::

    git clone https://github.com/AB-Ares/Py_Admittance.git
    cd Py_Admittance/
    pip install .

**Working with the example scripts**

To execute a script, it is only necessary to enter the `examples` directory and to run the file using the python command ::

    cd examples
    python Mars_AdmitLoc.py 
    python Mars_DSPLoc.py 

.. note::
    Depending on how your system is set up, it might be necessary to use
    explicitly ``python3`` and ``pip3`` instead of ``python`` and ``pip`` in
    the above commands.
